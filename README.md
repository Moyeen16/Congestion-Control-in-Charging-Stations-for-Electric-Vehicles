# Congestion-Control-in-Charging-Stations-for-Electric-Vehicles
This project has been submitted for the partial fulfilment of the degree of B.Tech. in Information Technology (Major Project)

Navigation systems can help in allocating public charging stations to electric vehicles (EVs) with the aim of minimizing EVs’ charging time by integrating sufficient data. However, the existing systems only consider their travel time and transform the allocation as a routing problem. Here, we involve the queuing time in stations as one part of EVs’ charging time, and another part is the travel time on roads. We constructed a joint-resource congestion game to describe the interaction between vehicles and resources. With a finite number of players (vehicles) and resources (roads and charging stations), there exists a Nash equilibrium. To realize a dynamic allocation work, we applied the Q-learning algorithm, defining sets of states and actions in our constructed environment. Finally Dynamic Pricing has been incorporated based on the congestion at the Charging Stations at a particular point of time.
